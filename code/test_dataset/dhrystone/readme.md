This folder contains codes of the [dhrystone](https://github.com/sifive/benchmark-dhrystone).
We implement it based on the open source projects: [tinyriscv](https://github.com/liangkangnan/tinyriscv).
We use the timer on our board to calculate the running time.

You can make it with the command

    ./make.sh

and the binary file will be located in ```./dhry/```
